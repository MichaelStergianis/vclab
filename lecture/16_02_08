real processes can be approximated with linear models

given training dataset of n instances with {x, y} input output pairs.
x is a vector of d dimensions

given inputs and outputs we can train a system to find a linear model

1. training {xi, yi} -> learn -> parameters of a linear model -> y_hat

2, predicition x_n+1 -> predict -> y_hat_n+1

y_hat(xi) = theta1 + xi*theta2

J(theta) = sum( (yi - y_hati)^2, 1, n) = sum( (y - theta1 - xi*theta2)^2, 1, n) 

Linear Prediction
	yi_hat = sum(xi_j * theta_j, 1, d)
