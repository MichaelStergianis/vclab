Adam Optimizer
==============
A Method for Stochastic Optimization
------------------------------------

### Why strive to understand optimization methods in neural networks?

	1. In order to better select an optimizer for a given task 
	2. To fine tune its hyperparameters with more ease

### How does it work at a logical level?
