Actually generating the data and taking random samplings from the data is trivial.
	All of that functionality is contained in DataGenerator and DataImport
If DataImport does not detect that data has been generated, simply by checking if the data directory exists
	it calls DataGenerator and creates 55000 training points, and 10000 testing points.
	Each of these points consist of 
			- 2x2 matrix containing random integers for each of the values
			- a label that is the sum of the four values


How to tackle the problem of finding the operation that connects our outputs to our inputs
	How do we know what inputs are relevant?
	How can we go through the process of seeing what elements are being combined in what ways?
	We are looking for an operation that describes their interactions
		Guesses such as elem[0] * elem[1] + elem[2] / elem[3] would be incorrect
			but how does a computer know this?
