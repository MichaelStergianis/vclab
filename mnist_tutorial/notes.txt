mnist is chosen as the starting point of tensor flow for a few reasons:
	1. It is fairly simple to compute, can be done on laptops.

	2. It is simple, 28 x 28 images. However, this quickly breaks down into a 
		 784-dimensional space. Illustrating to someone learning just how complex
		 machine learning is.
